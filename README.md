Purpose: follow the Github tutorial (Hello World!) to learn how to use it. 

About Me: I'm a chemical engineer currently working on an MS degree. For my masters, I'm studying the internal corrosion of natural gas pipelines. I got my first exposure into programming in undergrad with MATLAB and loved it. I'm trying to branch out from MATLAB and learn other languages. I've already got some experience through research in the following languages: MATLAB, R, VBA, VB.NET, C/C++ (for Arduino), and Python. I really enjoy programming and am very interested in learning more about it and potentially getting a career in it.
